            <h2>HEALTH CONCERNS</h2>
            <p>Different chemicals can leach from plastics to human bodies resulting in endocrine disruption, weight
                gain, insulin resistance, decreased reproductive health and cancer.
                <br>Plastics often contain harmful chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA),phthalates,and flame retardents.
                They breakdown and form microplastics like tiny particles that can be ingested and inhaled which can
                accumulate in the body and may cause inflammation

            <h2>FLORA AND FAUNA</h2>
            <p>The cumulative effect of plastic pollution can lead to the decline of species population, loss of
                biodiversity,and discription of ecosystem services.It can degrade slowly and release toxic chemicals
                into the soil,affecting soil quality. Wildlife can become entangled in plastic waste such as fishing
                nets,six-pack rings,and other debris. it's waste can alter and damage natural habitats such as coral
                reefs and beaches.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Production Emissions</h2>
            <p>Plastics are primarily made from fossil fuels (petroleum and natural gas). The extraction and refining of these materials release significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, both potent greenhouse gases.The energy required for plastic production often comes from burning fossil fuels, further contributing to GHG emission</p>
